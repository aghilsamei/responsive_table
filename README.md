# Responsive Table with Dynamic Features

This is a responsive table component built with React. It supports dynamic column sliding, theme toggling (light/dark mode), and allows the export of data to a CSV file. It is highly customizable and designed to be responsive, adjusting the number of columns displayed based on the screen size.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Responsive Design**:  The table is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. As the screen size decreases, columns are hidden, and a sliding feature is activated for smaller screens.

- **Sticky Columns**:  Columns you want to remain visible while scrolling can be made sticky by passing them through the stickyKeys prop.
- **CSV Export üìÅ**: Export visible table data to a CSV file.

- **Action Column**: An action column can be shown with options like "Edit" or "Delete". To display this, set 'showActionColumn={true}'.

- **Theme Toggle üåô‚òÄÔ∏è**: Switch between light and dark themes using the built-in theme toggle button.
